spectacular work!

# Pagination

The Pollination API provides several data intensive information. In order to keep our
servers happy, the API will automatically paginate the requested items. *It's important
to form calls with [Link header](#section/Pagination/Link-header) values instead of
constructing your own URLs.*

## Link header

The Link header includes pagination information. This is an example for model faces which
includes next and last page. Pollination uses same convention as GitHub API

```
Link: <https://api.pollination.cloud/<model-id>/faces?page=2&per_page=50>; rel="next",
<https://api.pollination.cloud/<model-id>/faces?page=50&per_page=50>; rel="last"
```

This Link response header contains one or more Hypermedia link relations. The possible
`rel` values are:


| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `next` | The link relation for the immediate next page of results. |
| `last` | The link relation for the last page of results. |
| `first` | The link relation for the first page of results. |
| `prev` | The link relation for the immediate previous page of results. |

# Example

This example is a step by step guide for running a grid-based simulation using
Pollination.

## 1. Create a model

The first step for creating a simulation is to
[submit your model](#operation/create_model). A model includes geometry and
related metadata for that geometry. It can be translated to analysis models that can be
used by engines such as Radiance, OpenStudio/ EnergyPlus.

[Pollination model](#operation/create_model) schema is a collection of different type
of faces. Each face can be a `Face`, `PolyFace` or a `ShadeFace`.

You can download a sample model from
[this link](https://github.com/pollination/model-service/blob/master/app/models/samples/model.py).

Once you have created your model you can [submit your `model`](#operation/create_model).
**POST /models** returns a `201 Created` response with with the `Location` information
in the header and an `id` in the response. Here is a sample response for a model
that is submitted successfully.

```json
{
  "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "message": "Use Location in headers to access the new object."
}
```

You can also use the `Link` to retrieve the model object.

```json
{
  "type": "Model",
  "id": "string",
  "name": "string",
  "convert_to_meters": 1,
  "face_count": 20,
  "created_at": "2019-04-07 22:34:16.764143",
  "url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/models/7bd00d58-6485-4ca6-b889-3da6d8df3ee4",
  "faces_url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/models/7bd00d58-6485-4ca6-b889-3da6d8df3ee4/faces"

}
```

Keep the model `id` for the final step to create a simulation.

**Pro tip**: In most cases you will use a single `model` to describe your simulation
scene however you can break down the scene in several models and send several models to a
single `simulation`. This is helpful for different scenarios. For instance you can create
the context as a separate model and then make a separate model for the test building. In
this case if you make a change to the building you don't have to resubmit the context.

Another scenario is for parametric studies where you can submit the static parts of the
scene as a separate model and then submit the parametric parts of the model separately
for each state. Now you can use the base model in combination with each state of the
parametric model to create several simulations without resubmitting the base model.


## 2. Create a sensor grid 

After submitting the models you need to create the sensor grids. A sensor grid is a
collection of sensors at which simulation values will be calculated. Each sensor has
6 values. The first 3 values represents the X, Y and Z coordinates for the location of
the sensor in 3D space. The second 3 values indicate the X, Y and Z components of the
vector for the direction that the sensor is facing.

You can submit a [sensor grid](#operation/create_sensor_grid) using **/sensor-grids**
endpoint. If your grid is valid you will receive a `201 Created` response with the `id`
for this grid. By now, you should know what you need to do. Keep the grid `id`!

```json
{
  "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
  "message": "Use Location in headers to access the new object."
}
```

You can also use the `Link` to retrieve the model object.

```json
{
  "type": "SensorGrid",
  "id": "7bd00d58-6485-4ca6-b889-3da6d8df3ee4",
  "sensor_count": 200,
  "name": "study_room",
  "url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/sensor-grids/7bd00d58-6485-4ca6-b889-3da6d8df3ee4",
  "sensors_url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/sensor-grids/7bd00d58-6485-4ca6-b889-3da6d8df3ee4/sensors"
}
```

## 3. Create a simulation

Now that we have the model ids and grid ids in hand we can create a `simulation`. Use
the [simulations](#operation/create_simulation) endpoint to submit your simulation. The
response will be `202 Accepted` with the `url` to the simulation. Now that the simulation
has been created you can use the `url` to [access the possible actions](#operation/get_simulation)
for this simulation. There will be one for starting the simulation. 
  
```json
{
  // [...] ,
  "actions": [
    {
      "description": "Start the simulation.",
      "verb": "put",
      "payload": {"action": "start"},
      "url": "api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42665544/actions"
    },
    {
      "description": "Stop the simulation.",
      "verb": "put",
      "payload": {"action": "stop"},
      "url": "api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42665544/actions"
    }
  ],
  // [...]
}
```

## 4. Start the simulation

Use the start action from step 3 to start the simulation. Starting a simulation is
considered an `action` and is accessible via the
[/simulations/{id}/actions](#operation/control_simulation) endpoint.

Once the simulation is started check the `simulation` using the simulation
`url` and monitor the `history` of the simulation. Possible options are `Created`,
`Started`, `Canceled` and `Finished`.

```json
{
  "type": "DaylightFactor",
  "grids": [
    "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
  ],
  "models": [
    "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000"
  ],
  "radiance_parameters": {
    "base": "default",
    "overwrite": "-ab 5 -aa 0.01 -ad 4800"
  },
  "name": "market_place_comfort_study",
  "id": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000",
  "depends_on": [
    "market_place_radiation_simulation",
    "market_place_airflow_simulation"
  ],
  "logs": "https://api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000/logs",
  "outputs": [
    {
      "verb": "post",
      "description": "*.res file generated by Radiance.",
      "payload": {
        "output": "file"
      },
      "url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000/outputs"
    },
    {
      "verb": "post",
      "description": "List of list of values for each sensor-grid.",
      "payload": {
        "output": "values"
      },
      "url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000/outputs"
    },
    {
      "verb": "post",
      "description": "List of average values for each sensor-grid.",
      "payload": {
        "output": "average"
      },
      "url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000/outputs"
    }
  ],
  "actions": [
    {
      "description": "Start the simulation.",
      "verb": "put",
      "payload": {
        "action": "start"
      },
      "url": "api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42665544/actions"
    },
    {
      "description": "Stop the simulation.",
      "verb": "put",
      "payload": {
        "action": "stop"
      },
      "url": "api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42665544/actions"
    }
  ],
  "status": {
    "status": "Started",
    "history": [
        {
          "status": "Created",
          "timestamp": "2019-03-11T18:47:13Z"
        },
        {
          "status": "Started",
          "timestamp": "2019-03-11T18:47:33Z"
        }
    ]

  }
}
```

Once the simulation is `Finished` you should check the `status` to see if the simulation
has `Failed` or `Succeeded`. If the status is `Failed` you can see the `logs` field in
the same response. Otherwise, it is the time to retrieve the simulation outputs! :D

## 5. Retrieve the outputs

If you look closer at the response for simulation there is also a field for `outputs`.
Similar to `start` and `stop`, `outputs` are also `actions`. Each output has its specific
information. Here is a possible list of outputs for a daylight factor simulation.

```json
{
  // [...] ,
  "outputs": [
    {
      "verb": "post",
      "description": "*.res file generated by Radiance.",
      "payload": {
        "output": "file"
      },
      "url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000/outputs"
    },
    {
      "verb": "post",
      "description": "List of list of values for each sensor-grid.",
      "payload": {
        "output": "values"
      },
      "url": "https://api.pollination.cloud/simulations/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000/outputs"
    }
  ],
  // [...]
}
```

Keep in mind that most of outputs result in generating new resources and are
accessed by `Post` requests. Once you request an output the response returns a url to
access the final results.


## 6. Workflows

You can use [Pollination workflows](#tag/Workflow) to execute more than one simulation
at the same time. A workflow can be used to run parametric studies or to create custom
combination of simulations. Simulations can depend on each other and the outputs from one
simulation can be passed to one or more follow up simulations.
